# Treatment response cohort 

The treatment response cohort consists of all those in the diabetes cohort (n=401,998; see [flow diagram](https://github.com/Exeter-Diabetes/SDRN-Cohort-scripts/blob/main/README.md#introduction)) who have at least one script for a glucose-lowering medication (drug classes: acarbose, DPP4-inhibitor, glinide, GIPGLP1-receptor co-agonist, GLP1-receptor agonist, metformin, SGLT2-inhibitor, sulphonylurea, thiazolidinedione, or insulin). The index date is the drug start date of the glucose-lowering medication. Patients can appear in the cohort multiple times with different drugs or if they stop and then re-start a medication. For all of our primary analyses, scripts are processed by drug class (i.e. changes from one medication to another within the same class are ignored). The final dataset contains biomarker, comorbidity, sociodemographic and medication info at drug start dates, as well as 6-/12-month biomarker response. As a secondary analysis, drugs were grouped by drug substance rather than drug class (drug substances: Acarbose, Acetohexamide, Albiglutide, Alogliptin, Canagliflozin, Chlorpropamide, Dapagliflozin, Dulaglutide, Empagliflozin, Ertugliflozin, Exenatide, Exenatide prolonged-release, Glibenclamide, Gliclazide, Glimepiride, Glipizide, Gliquidone, Glymidine, High-dose semaglutide, Insulin, Linagliptin, Liraglutide, Lixisenatide, Low-dose semaglutide, Metformin, Nateglinide, Oral semaglutide, Pioglitazone, Repaglinide, Rosiglitazone, Saxagliptin, Semaglutide dose unclear, Sitagliptin, Tirzepatide, Tolazamide, Tolbutamide, Troglitazone, Vildagliptin); the 01_drug_sorting_and_combos prodcues tables by both drug class and drug substance.

MASTERMIND (MRC APBI Stratification and Extreme Response Mechanism IN Diabetes) is a UK Medical Research Council funded (MR/N00633X/1 and MR/W003988/1) study consortium exploring stratified (precision) treatment in Type 2 diabetes. Part of this work uses the Type 2 subset of the treatment response cohort. Originally CPRD GOLD was used and processed as per [Rodgers et al. 2017](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/7/10/e017989). In 2020-2021 we recreated this processing pipeline in CPRD Aurum using an October 2020 extract (see (October2020-download branch)[https://github.com/Exeter-Diabetes/CPRD-Cohort-scripts/tree/Oct2020-download] of the CPRD repository). In 2024 we have run the same pipeline on a June 2024 CPRD Aurum extract. In 2025 we have run a very similar pipeline on a 2023 NDS cohort, and this directory contains the scripts used to do this. Selected MASTERMIND papers can be found at the bottom of this page.

From 2024 our papers use a standard colour palette for the different Type 2 diabetes treatments:
- ![#e69f00](https://placehold.co/15x15/e69f00/e69f00.png) `#E69F00` for SGLT2i
- ![#56B4E9](https://placehold.co/15x15/56B4E9/56B4E9.png) `#56B4E9` for GLP1-RA
- ![#CC79A7](https://placehold.co/15x15/CC79A7/CC79A7.png) `#CC79A7` for SU
- ![#0072B2](https://placehold.co/15x15/0072B2/0072B2.png) `#0072B2` for DPP4i
- ![#D55E00](https://placehold.co/15x15/D55E00/D55E00.png) `#D55E00` for TZD

\*SIMD=Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation; 'static' using the 2016 data. SIMD is coded as 1=most deprived, 10=least deprived. This differs from England deprivation score, where 1=least deprived, 10=most deprived. Two variables have been created: simd_decile (scottish version), imd_decile (translation of scottish to english).

The scripts shown in the above diagram (in grey boxes) can be found in this directory, except those which are common to the other cohorts (all_diabetes_cohort, all_patid_death_causes) which are in the upper directory of this repository.

## Script details

'Drug' refers to diabetes medications unless otherwise stated, and the drug classes analysed by these scripts are acarbose, DPP4-inhibitors, glinides, GLP1 receptor agonists, metformin, SGLT2-inhibitors, sulphonylureas, thiazolidinediones, and insulin. 'Outputs' are the primary MySQL tables produced by each script. See also notes on the [aurum package](https://github.com/Exeter-Diabetes/CPRD-analysis-package) and [CPRD-Codelists respository](https://github.com/Exeter-Diabetes/CPRD-Codelists) in the upper directory of this repository ([here](https://github.com/Exeter-Diabetes/SDRN-Cohort-scripts#script-details)).
